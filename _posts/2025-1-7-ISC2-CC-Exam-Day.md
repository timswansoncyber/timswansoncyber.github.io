Hey all! I am proud to announce that after a few weeks of preparation, I have taken and passed the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity Exam! I want to take a quick second to reflect on my experience. This is just the beginning of my cybersecurity journey as I keep pursuing other certificates (such as CySA+, and PenTest+) to keep becoming the best candidate I can be. For those interested or currently pursuing this certification, I highly recommend using the University of Miami's practice exams on LinkedIn as they are free and helped tremendously in my exam preparation. 

As I've pursued internships in cybersecurity for this upcoming summer, it was made clear that certifications are necessary for getting your foot through the door in cybersecurity. I believe that ISC2's CC has laid a firm foundation for me to build off of when it comes to developing both defensive and offensive skills for the industry.

Thank you to everyone who is following along in my journey!
