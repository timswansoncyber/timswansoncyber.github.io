This past weekend, I had the privelige of going to a Leadership Conference with my Christian RSO, Cru. I currently am already leading in Cru, so a lot of what we talked about was already familiar to me. We talked about what it means to lead: sacrifice. Ultimately, leaders must be servants and act in the interest of others, even if it costs them something. While it may sound grim, being a servant is a huge blessing as people begin to appreciate you and you feel fulfilled with a sense of purpose. Our main mission in Cru is to help people find and know Jesus through Bible Studies, weekly meetings, and socials. I have personally been able to grow a lot in my faith as I share the Gospel on campus, lead a weekly Bible study, and give/receive dicipleship.

Here are some of my takeaways from Leadership Conference: 

I think that it is easy to get caught up in our own lives and forget about the people around us. So take that step of faith to serve someone in your life. Make a meal for someone or take them out to eat. Ask them how they are really doing, and push past the wall when they say "good" or "I'm fine". Take a risk and ask someone about their spiritual background and possibly even share the Gospel with them. That would be awesome!

We also heard a story about Moses and his initial refusal and excuses for avoiding the plan that the Lord had for him. The Lord was calling him to be a leader for his people and he was unwilling, and this kindled the Lord's anger. I was able to apply this story to my own life as I contemplate what to do during my last upcoming summer before graduation in December 2025. Initially, I wanted to land an IT or Cybersecurity internship over the summer, but the Lord had other plans for me. Instead, I will be going to Central Asia, one of the most unreached regions in the whole world with hopes of sharing the Gospel there. It was a hard pill to swallow when all of my hard work resulted in countless rejection letters from employers. About the only thing that I got accepted to was this trip, which was telling to say the least. 

I didn't want to go at first, but now I am excited because I trust that the Lord will not only move in the heats of the people that we will be ministering to, but also my heart as well.
