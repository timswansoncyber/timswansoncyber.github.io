# Hello! My name is Tim Swanson and I am from Chicagoland. I am currently studying information systems (cybersecurity concentration) at Central Michigan University. I am currently working at Oberweis Dairy as a shift leader, but I am also working on some personal cybersecurity projects as my end career goal is to have my cybersecurity consulting company. I am currently studying for my ISC2 CC and will hopefully be pursuing CompTIA CYSA+ and Pentest+ in the near future! 

# I am also an officer in Cru, which is a evangelical Christian ministry that exists worldwide. I currently lead a Bible study on campus with one of my roommates and even mentor my own disciple. I enjoy going to the gym and playing video games with my friends outside of school, Cru, and my personal cyber projects.
